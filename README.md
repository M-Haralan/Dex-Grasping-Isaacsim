# Isaac Sim ROS2 Workspaces

This repository contains two workspaces: `humble_ws` (ROS2 Humble) and `jazzy_ws` (ROS2 Jazzy). 
It was forked from the [Official NVIDIA ROS2 Workspace](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacSim-ros_workspaces#)

When cloning this repository, both workspaces are downloaded. Only the `jazzy_ws` is being updated and used.
